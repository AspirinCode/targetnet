# TargetNet

This repository (`master` branch) stores the source code of the Shiny web application [TargetNet](http://targetnet.org). The web application is currently hosted on shinyapps.io.

The `gh-pages` branch serves the information pages for the [632 drug targets](http://nanx.me/targetnet/), which are normally accessed from the application.
