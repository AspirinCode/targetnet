# TargetNet

This repository (`master` branch) stores the source code of the Shiny web application [TargetNet](http://targetnet.org).

The `gh-pages` branch serves the information pages for the [632 drug targets](https://nanx.me/targetnet/), which could be accessed from the web application itself.

The web application is hosted by shinyapps.io.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact: [me@nanx.me](mailto:me@nanx.me).
