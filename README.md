# TargetNet <img src="logo.png" align="right" alt="logo" height="180" width="180" />

TargetNet is a Shiny web application for predicting the binding probability of 623 potential drug targets for given small molecule(s). It is driven by large-scale machine learning modeling of public chemogenomics data.

## Structure

This repository (`master` branch) archives the source code of the Shiny web application [TargetNet](http://targetnet.org).

The `gh-pages` branch serves the information pages for the [632 drug targets](https://nanx.me/targetnet/), which could be accessed from the web application itself.

The web application is hosted by shinyapps.io.
